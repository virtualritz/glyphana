# Glyphana

[![Build Status](https://github.com/virtualritz/glyphana/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/virtualritz/glyphana/actions?workflow=CI)

Glyphana is a tool to search for and discover unicode glyphs. It is inspired by the macOS Character Viewer which I sorely miss on Linux and Windows.

## Installation & Updates

For now you need to have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Simply run:

```
cargo install glyphana
```

Make sure you have `cargo-update` installed.
You only need to do that once:

```
cargo install cargo-update
```

After that, updating is as simple as:

```
cargo install-update glyphana
```
